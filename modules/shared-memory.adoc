= Shared Memory


Shared memory is one of the fastest IPC (Inter-process communication) mechanisms in Linux. There are two types of shared memory objects: System V and POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface).
Because the containers in a pod share the IPC namespace of the pod infrastructure container, they can automatically share the System V shared memory objects.

A POSIX shared memory object is a memory-mapped file, which requires a tmpfs (temporary filesystem) mounted at *_/dev/shm_*.
Because the containers in a pod do not share their mount namespaces, you can use volumes to provide the same *_/dev/shm_* to each container in a pod.
